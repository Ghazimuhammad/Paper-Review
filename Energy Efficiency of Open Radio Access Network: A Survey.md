This paper, we investigate the O-RAN from an Energy efficiency (EE) perspective by reviewing the state-of-the-art power consumption models, and EE techniques that have been proposed to minimize the energy consumption of O-RAN. In addition, the challenges associated with the optimization of the EE of O-RAN and opportunities for further research are highlighted.

## Introduction
* The radio access network (RAN) has evolved from a distributed architecture to a centralized/cloud-RAN (C-RAN) and now to an open-RAN (O-RAN) architecture.
* The O-RAN architecture includes three network entities: Centralised Unit (CU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Radio Unit (RU), and uses open radio interfaces and virtualization of network functions.
* O-RAN facilitates cost savings, broadens the supply chain, enables network scalability, intelligent network management, efficient resource allocation, and reduced CAPEX/OPEX.
* The impact of O-RAN on energy consumption is still an area of open research.
* This paper investigates O-RAN's energy efficiency (EE) by reviewing power consumption models and techniques for improving EE.
